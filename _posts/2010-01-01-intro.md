### Introduction

**mrsFAST** is designed to map short reads to reference genome assemblies; in a fast and memory-efficient manner. **mrsFAST** is a cache-oblivous short read mapper that optimizes cache usage to get higher performance.

Currently Supported Features:

- Mismatches, no indels
- Paired-end Mapping
- Discordant Paired-end Mapping (to be used in conjunction with [Variation Hunter](http://variationhunter.sourceforge.net))
- Best Mapping
- Limited Mapping
- SNP-aware Mapping
- Multi-threading

*Legacy Bisulfite Mapping Mode (see version 1.2.6.4): This is a legacy version and is not being supported at the moment. We are aware of a small bug in paired-end mode of mrsFAST-1.2.6.4 that causes mrsFAST to lose some of its mapping locations(<2%). This legacy version is not cache oblivious.*
