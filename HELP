mrsFAST : Micro-Read Substitutions (only) Fast Alignment Search Tool.

mrsFAST is a cache oblivious read mapping tool. mrsFAST capable of mapping
single and paired end reads to the reference genome. Bisulfite treated 
sequences are not supported in this version. By default mrsFAST reports  
the output in SAM format.

Usage: mrsFAST [options]

General Options:
 -v|--version		Current Version.
 -h			Shows the help file.


Indexing Options:
 --index [file]		Generate an index from the specified fasta file. 
 -ws [int]		Set window size for indexing (default:12-min:8 max:14).


Searching Options:
 --search [file]	Search the specified genome. Index file should be 
			in same directory as the fasta file.
 --pe 			Search will be done in Pairedend mode.
 --seq [file]		Input sequences in fasta/fastq format [file]. If 
			pairend reads are interleaved, use this option.
 --seq1 [file]		Input sequences in fasta/fastq format [file] (First 
			file). Use this option to indicate the first file of 
			pair-end reads. You can use this option alone in 
			bisulfite mode. 
 --seq2 [file]		Input sequences in fasta/fastq format [file] (Second 
			file). Use this option to indicate the second file of 
			pair-end reads. You can use this option alone in 
			bisulfite mode. 
 -o [file]		Output of the mapped sequences. The default is output.
 --seqcomp 		Indicates that the input sequences are compressed(gz).
 --outcomp 		Indicates that output file should be compressed(gz).
 -n [int]		Maximum number of locations reported for a sequence 
			(default 0, all mappings). 
 -e [int]		hamming distance (default 2).
 --min [int]		Min inferred distance allowed between two pairend sequences.
 --max [int]		Max inferred distance allowed between two pairend sequences.
 --thread [int]		Number of threads that should be used for mapping. Default is one. 0 will choose all the available cpus for threading.
